# Software-Security

Artemis Financial is an online transaction mediator. They required secure code which meets international standards, can verify users, and send encrypted info. An easy solution to their lack of encryption was the use of hash functions. Before data could encrypted and sent, I had to write clean/encapsulated code. Then I had to setup a secure server connection. Finally, the encrypted data could be sent in the encrypted form which contained a key. Only a user with the proper certificate could decipher the data package. Wile implementing these steps I used MAVEN to help identify vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate their potential affects on the program. MAVEN made this process easier by automating the process of rooting through the individual libraries and identifying weaknesses. I think the most impressive part of this project was integrating the use of hash functions which could be sent and deciphered in conjunction with the generation of certificates.
